<h1>Rock-paper-scissors cellular automata</h1>
<div class="text">
    <p>Experiment inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/M4cV0nCIZoc">this video</a>.</p>
    <p>Each pixel corresponds to a cell. Red eats blue, blue eats green, green eats red. Black is assimilated randomly
        by one of its neighbors. Each cell begins with a certain number of points. At each iteration, it ages, losing
        one point. For one cell to eat another, it needs to have a higher level than its prey. Whenever a cell is eaten,
        its points are restored to the original value. Finally, young cells are not edible, meaning their predators will
        have to wait for it to age.</p>
